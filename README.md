# Teddy Petrou's COVID-19 Data Exploration Work

This repository contains detailed data analysis and visualizations of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic within Jupyter Notebooks. The results of this work are presented here, on my [Medium Blog](medium.com/dunder-data) and my Twitter(twitter.com/tedpetrou)

## Support!

If you would like to support my work as an independent data scientist covering COVID-19, purchase one of the three packages. At each level, you'll be first in line to be notified about any live presentations.

* [Observer][1] - Master the fundamentals of Python with Exercise Python (200+ page book with 100+ exercises)
* [Builder][1] - Build an Interactive Analytics Dashboard with Python - Learn how build my Coronavirus Forecasting Dashboard
* [Creator][1] - All Access Pass (lifetime access to all course) plus you'll get to work with me personally to build a data analysis project (up to 2 hours of work)

## How to Use

The Jupyter Notebooks (files that end in .ipynb) contain python code, data, visualizations, and text that describes the analysis. It is not necessary to understand any of the python code to understand the contents of the notebooks. They read like blog posts with some code intertwined within. You may safely skip the code.

For those with Python knowledge, please feel free to use them to reproduce the analysis and improve upon it.
